==============================================================================
Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name | upper }}, released at name: {{ .Release.Name }}.
==============================================================================

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}  # information about running pods and this message
  $ helm get {{ .Release.Name }}     # get full Kubernetes specification

This release includes:

 * One dask scheduler,
 * A minimum of {{ .Values.dask_worker.replicas }} and at most {{ .Values.dask_worker.maxReplicas}} dask workers.
   The exact number is dynamic and depends on a horizontal pod scaler.
 * A total of {{ len .Values.jobs }} cron jobs to automatically run some of the
   iguazu pipelines.

The scheduler expose external services to which you can connect directly to the
Dask cluster. However, **WE HAVE NOT TESTED THIS THROUGHLY**. It is not
straightforward because you need to create a proxy to connect directly to the
dask-scheduler service.
In other words, this port is not open to outside the cluster for security purposes.

The dask UI is available to outside the cluster. You can connect by visiting
the webpage on the IP address shown on the ingress service:

  $ kubectl get services

or with

  $ echo $(kubectl get services -l 'app=nginx-ingress,component=controller' -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.clusterIP}')

Note: it may take a minute for the IP to become available.

You can watch the status of the most important objects of this chart with:

  $ kubectl get pods,services,hpa,cronjobs -l app=iguazu
