Welcome to Iguazu's documentation!
==================================

Iguazú Falls or Iguaçu Falls (Spanish: Cataratas del Iguazú [kataˈɾatas ðel iɣwaˈsu];
Guarani: Chororo Yguasu [ɕoɾoɾo ɨɣʷasu]; Portuguese: Cataratas do Iguaçu
[kataˈɾatɐs du iɡwaˈsu]) are waterfalls of the Iguazu River on the border of
the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paraná. Together,
they make up the largest waterfall system in the world.[2]
The falls divide the river into the upper and lower Iguazu.


The name "Iguazú" comes from the Guarani or Tupi words "y" [ɨ], meaning "water",
and "ûasú "[waˈsu], meaning "big".[3] Legend has it that a deity planned to marry
a beautiful woman named Naipí, who fled with her mortal lover Tarobá in a canoe.
In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the waterfalls and condemning the
lovers to an eternal fall.[3] The first European to record the existence of the
falls was the Spanish Conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1541.
